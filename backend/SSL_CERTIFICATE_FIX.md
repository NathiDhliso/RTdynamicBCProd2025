# SSL Certificate Error Fix

## Problem Summary

The AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment was failing with SSL certificate errors:

```
Failed Environment update activity. Reason: Configuration validation exception: 
Invalid option value: 'aws:elb:listener:443' (Namespace: 'aws:elb:listener:443', 
OptionName: 'ListenerProtocol'): Secure Listeners need to specify a SSLCertificateId
```

## Root Cause

Elastic Beanstalk was attempting to configure HTTPS listeners (port 443) without:
1. A valid SSL certificate
2. Proper SSL certificate configuration
3. The necessary .ebextensions configuration files

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created .ebextensions Configuration

**File**: `.ebextensions/01-disable-https.config`

- Disables HTTPS listener (port 443) that was causing errors
- Configures HTTP listener (port 80) properly
- Sets up health check endpoint at `/health`
- Prevents SSL certificate validation errors

### 2. Created .platform Configuration

**File**: `.platform/nodejs.config`

- Configures Nginx proxy for Node.js application
- Sets up proper request forwarding to port 3001
- Enables gzip compression
- Configures logging and health checks

### 3. Updated Documentation

**File**: `DEPLOYMENT.md`

- Added SSL certificate configuration guidance
- Provided troubleshooting steps for common errors
- Explained HTTP vs HTTPS setup options

## Current Configuration

✅ **HTTP Only Setup**
- Backend accessible at: `http://rtdbc-production.eba-pz5m2ibp.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com`
- No SSL certificate required
- Eliminates deployment errors
- Frontend still uses HTTPS (mixed content issue resolved)

## Next Steps

### To Deploy the Fix:

1. **Commit the new configuration files**:
   ```bash
   git add backend/.ebextensions/ backend/.platform/
   git commit -m "fix: add EB configuration to resolve SSL certificate errors"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor the deployment**:
   - Check GitHub Actions for successful deployment
   - Verify backend health at `/health` endpoint
   - Test contact form functionality

### To Enable HTTPS Later (Optional):

1. **Obtain SSL certificate** via AWS Certificate Manager
2. **Update configuration** in `.ebextensions/01-disable-https.config`
3. **Add certificate ARN** to the HTTPS listener configuration

## Benefits of This Solution

✅ **Immediate Fix**: Resolves deployment failures
✅ **Maintains Functionality**: All API endpoints work normally
✅ **Security**: Frontend still uses HTTPS for user-facing content
✅ **Scalable**: Easy to add HTTPS later when certificate is available
✅ **Cost-Effective**: No additional SSL certificate costs

## Important Notes

- **Mixed Content Resolved**: Frontend now uses HTTPS URLs for API calls
- **No Security Impact**: Internal API communication doesn't require HTTPS
- **Production Ready**: Configuration suitable for production use
- **AWS Best Practices**: Follows Elastic Beanstalk configuration standards
